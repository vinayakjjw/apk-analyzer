# Overview

APK Analysis Tool is a Streamlit-based web application for analyzing Android APK files. The tool provides comprehensive metadata extraction, security analysis, and comparison capabilities for Android applications. Users can upload APK files to examine their structure, permissions, features, signatures, and other technical details. The application supports single APK analysis, batch analysis of multiple APKs, and side-by-side comparison of two APKs with intelligent security concern detection.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Streamlit Web Framework**: The application uses Streamlit for the web interface, providing an interactive dashboard with file upload capabilities, data visualization, and comparison views
- **Responsive Layout**: Wide layout configuration with expandable sidebar for mode selection
- **Component-Based UI**: Modular interface with separate views for single analysis, batch analysis, and dual comparison modes
- **Security Highlighting**: Real-time security concern detection with prominent warning display
- **Batch Processing**: Progress tracking and summary statistics for multiple APK analysis

## Backend Architecture
- **Modular Analysis System**: Core functionality separated into specialized analyzer classes:
  - `APKAnalyzer`: Main APK analysis engine using androguard library
  - `SignatureAnalyzer`: Dedicated certificate and signature verification
  - `APKComparator`: Side-by-side comparison logic for multiple APKs
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Sequential analysis workflow extracting metadata, permissions, features, and security information
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with graceful degradation for partial analysis results

## Data Processing
- **APK Parsing**: Uses androguard library for deep APK structure analysis and bytecode examination
- **Certificate Analysis**: Cryptography library integration for X.509 certificate parsing and signature scheme detection
- **Metadata Extraction**: XML manifest parsing for application configuration and component discovery
- **File Structure Analysis**: ZIP-based APK inspection for resource and binary analysis

## Security Analysis
- **Permission Analysis**: Comprehensive Android permission extraction and categorization
- **Signature Verification**: Multi-scheme signature validation (v1-v4 APK signing schemes)
- **Certificate Chain Analysis**: X.509 certificate validity and algorithm verification
- **Debug Flag Detection**: Security configuration analysis for production readiness

## Utility Functions
- **Data Formatting**: Human-readable file size formatting and safe data access patterns
- **Package Name Processing**: Standardized Android package identifier handling
- **Permission Display**: Clean permission name formatting for user interface presentation
